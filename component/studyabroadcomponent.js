                It is particularly common to hear students ask questions as it
                regards their study abroad mission. Getting an abroad education
                is becoming interesting day by day especially, as it is one of
                the best ways of migrating to another country. To study abroad,
                you need adequate information that would help you have a smooth
                sail getting admission and visa approved. As a result of this, I
                present to you some study abroad frequently asked questions you
                should know. Despite that the tuition fee is always higher as
                compared to what one can get in his or her home country, many
                international students prefer studying abroad. Obtaining a
                foreign degree can be expensive in some countries especially
                top-tier countries like Canada, the United States, UK, and
                Australia, however, you can find cheap tuition fee universities
                in Europe and Asia. Now, let’s see some of the study abroad
                frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers.

              <Typography gutterBottom>
                Are you among those asking this question “why study abroad?
                Well, ‘to each is his own as what may interest you may not
                interest another. Generally, a large number of students who seek
                abroad education desire to earn a foreign degree. Among the top
                reasons for study abroad, enthusiasts are obtaining a degree
                with global recognition. For example, a degree obtained from
                Canadian, UK, US, and German universities is internationally
                recognized. What this means is that you can present your B.sc or
                M.sc obtained from any of these countries for work purpose, and
                it will be accepted. Secondly, students perceive studying abroad
                as a route for migration. Although there are different types of
                visas one can apply for, the study visa which comes with a
                longer validity period seems the best option that in the end, a
                student can apply for a post-study visa that could lead to
                permanent residency, also, most schools abroad offer study and
                work opportunity, with this student earn while studying.

                depends on your budget- tuition fee, and general cost of living,
                choice of program, medium of instruction, acceptance rate, ease
                of getting a visa, etc. You need to put these factors into
                consideration when looking for a place to study. If you’re
                looking for affordable tuition fee universities in the world,
                then schools in Europe should be your best bet, but the language
                barrier is another issue you may want to consider. Even though
                you can find some English-taught programs in your chosen school,
                the tuition shoots up, apart from that, it may take you time to
                adapt as you’re expected to communicate in their language, that
                could take you years to learn which can also affect your chance
                of getting a part-time job while studying. On the other hand, if
                you’re not overly bothered about cost, the United States,

                The National Examinations Council (NECO) is a written
                examination for graduating classes in Nigeria. This certificate
                is similar to the West African School Certificate Examinations
                (WAEC) which is recognized within the West African countries and
                other countries. To study abroad, you need either a WAEC or NECO
                result. To answer the question if one can study abroad with a
                NECO/GCE result, yes you can. But first, you should check the
                entry requirements of the school and program. GCE is far
                recognized especially, for schools in the UK, Canada, and the
                United States.

                The intake period for some schools differs. For most schools in
                Europe, admission starts by September, which means, you should
                start applying for admission early enough. To prevent any
                last-minute problems, students can always apply well ahead of
                the deadline. Students aiming for the September intake should
                start preparing their application as of May but if you’re yet to
                write any of the language tests, February may be a better
                option. It is better to apply early as most schools consider
                early applicants. Some schools operate 2-3 intake periods,
                namely, Fall, Spring, Autumn, meaning that the application
                deadlines vary by school.

                To study abroad, students must fulfill all the admission
                requirements. The Entry requirements vary based on the school,
                study level, and at times, student’s nationality. For example,
                the entry requirements for non-EU students and that of EU
                students planning to study in any European country differs. It
                is, therefore, important to check the entry requirements before
                hitting the ‘apply button’ on the school website, go to the
                right section. International students should only click on the
                box meant for foreign students, from there, other information
                like a choice of program, study level would be selected. The
                entry requirements are just lists of documents a student is
                required to provide for admission. Every document listed out
                there is important, do not ignore any unless it is specified

                know if it is among the admission requirements. The importance
                of a second language/ language test is to evaluate a student’s

                halls/dormitories. It is cheaper to live in a school hostel, but
                the convenience may be a factor to consider. Freshmen are
                advised to stay in the school-provided accommodation until they
                get to their second or third year in the university. The
                benefits include no transportation cost as dormitories are cited
                on campus, you meet friends with different cultural backgrounds.
                Other accommodation options include: Shared apartment You can
                choose to stay in a shared apartment. It is provided by schools,
                where students live in a separate room but share either kitchen.
                The cost of a shared apartment is a bit higher than school
                dormitories because they are usually furnished by the school.
                So, you don’t need to spend buying furniture unless, you need
                one for yourself, and can go along with it when leaving. Private
                apartment Here, you can look for a house within or outside the
                school. Private accommodation is expensive; you will cater for
                all the utility bills. It is not the best option for many
                students, but if money is never the problem, then, it is a
                perfect place to stay especially, for students who want privacy.
                Homestay If you fancy the idea of staying with a family, then
                this option may be for you. A homestay accommodation helps a
                student learn a language and the local culture faster, also,
                students get to botherless on food, because breakfast and dinner
                are included in the offer but the price for these services
                attract a higher price than staying in a school dormitory or
                shared apartment.

                countries that permit study and work, students- domestic and
                international students can work for 20 hours per week during an
                academic session, while during the holiday, they are allowed to
                work for 40 hours or more as the case may be. To be eligible for

                opportunities.
